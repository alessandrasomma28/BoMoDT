BoMoDT is the *Mobility Digital Twin* (MoDT) prototype designed for the Italian City of *Bologna* (Bo). Developed 
following a *Model-Driven Architecture* (MDA) approach and using automatized model-to-model transformations 
[**MoDT-M2M-MTT**](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoDT-M2M-TT/README.md) tool, BoMoDT is based on *open-source data* retrieved from the Municipality of Bologna and *open-source technologies*, i.e., **FIWARE** for data management and data interoperability and **Eclipse Simulator of Urban MObility** (SUMO) for traffic conditions modeling and simulations.
